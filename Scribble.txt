Show the output in light-red color() background (code: #ff6961) if the server status is offline.
Show the output in light-green color() background (code: #90EE90) if the server status is online.


Agenda: As of now, the server component was developed in such a way that if the server is offline, then the background color is light-red; and if the server is online, then the background color is light-green.
Add style class to print the message in white color (in addition to light-green color background) if the server is online.



<h1 ngClass="{'online':'condition'}">Tollplus India Pvt.Ltd</h1>

Routing and Navigation in Angular:
Agenda: When user navigates to URL: http://localhost:4200  two buttons should be shown with captions Departments, and Employees. When user clicks on button with caption Departments, the department details should be shown. Same case for employees.
01. Generate "department-list", and "employee-list" components
02. Configure the routes in app-routing.module.ts, and app.module.ts. Follow below style to avoid duplication.
    02.1. Declare "routingComponents" array const in app-routing.module.ts with all the ComponentNames
    02.2. Import "routingComponents" constant into app.module.ts declarations section.
03. To specify where these components have to be displayed, "router-outlet" directive in app.component.html file is helpful.
	==> F5 -> Below two URLs should work.
	http://localhost:4200/departments
	http://localhost:4200/employees
04. As page-not-found code implementation is also done, if I try to navigate to http://localhost:4200/invalidurl, "Page Not Found" message should be shown.
05. As default route configuration is also done, the page should navigate to "departments" when I typed http://localhost:4200

------------------------------------------------

Route Parameters in Angular:
Agenda:  "Department-list" component should contain the list of departments. When you click on the department, you have to navigate to Department-detail component with the message: You selected department with id = <id>
01. Write code in department-list component to display all the department details
02. Create "department-detail" component. As soon as we've created the component, and if that needs to be participated in navigation, we need to add route in app-routing.module.ts file.
    => Click on some department and see if the page is navigating properly. The selected department id should be available in the URL.
03. Now, we need to read the URL parameter to display it in the view. For this, we use "ActivatedRoute" service in department-detail.component.ts file.

Agenda: Bind Data to a Model in Angular. Use "ngModel" properties to provide visual feedback to the user as they’re filling the form. Validate form fields and apply an appropriate class to visually indicate to the user when the form is invalid. Show appropriate validation error message if one exists. Disable the submit button as long as form data is invalid, and enable when the form data becomes valid.
01. app.module.ts → import FormsModule from @angular/forms into imports array.
02. Create an instance of User model in forms-example1.component.ts file, and use it to bind to the form.
03. One example: [(ngModel)]=”userModel.name” ← we’re binding name property of userModel model to ngModel of name input element and vice versa.
04. Angular Forms Validation, Important ngModel properties to consider:
untouched, touched
pristine, dirty
valid, invalid
=> F5 -> As the values have been substituted in .ts file, you should be able to see 2nd json pipe.


untouched	* touched
prestine	dirty
valid		* invalid

Name - Required
Email - Required, pattern - RegEx
Phone - pattern - RegEx
Dropdown - some value should be selected. Must not be default.
Options button
Checkbox

email.errors

Submitting form data in Angular:
Agenda: Create an Angular service and send data to the server. Handle errors after the form is submitted.
use the below command to create a service.
D:\path>ng generate service enrollment

IMPORTANT NOTE: In enrollment.service.ts file, catchError cannot be imported by default. Hence, we need to write import statement explicity.
